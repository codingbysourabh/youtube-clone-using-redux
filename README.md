# youtube-clone-using-redux
    Overiew:
        This is my first project in react where I used api and redux. This project gives basic idea about how to use api in react. 
    Key points:
    Redux: 
        -Redux is an state management JavaScript library for managing the     application state.
        -For communication between two components that don't have a parent-child relationship, you can set up your own global event system.
        This is where Redux comes in handy. Redux offers a solution of storing all your application state in one place, called a 'store'. Components then "dispatch" state changes to the store, not directly to other components in a onedirectional way.
        -Without Redux, you would have to make data dependent on the components and pass it through different componentes to where it's needed.
        -With Redux, we can make state data independent of the components, and when needed, a component can across or update through the Redux store.
